The project aims to create a user-friendly to-do list web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application will allow users to view, add, and mark tasks as completed. The to-do list will be displayed in a card-based format, with each task having a title, description, and a "Done" button. The application will also have a form to add new tasks.

Objective:

The objective of this project is to create a user-friendly to-do list web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application should allow users to view, add, and mark tasks as completed, and display the to-do list in a card-based format.

Project Report:

Key Points:

HTML Structure: Create a well-organized HTML structure with a logical hierarchy, including a header, main section, task section, form, and to-do list.
CSS Styling: Add styles to the HTML structure using CSS, focusing on making the application visually appealing and user-friendly.
Task Cards: Display tasks in a card-based format, with each task having a title, description, and "Done" button.
Form: Create a form to allow users to add new tasks, with an input field and "Add Task" button.
To-Do List: Display the to-do list dynamically, updating it when new tasks are added or tasks are marked as completed.
JavaScript Functionality: Add event listeners to the "Done" buttons to mark tasks as completed, and to the "Add Task" button to add new tasks to the to-do list.
User Experience: Ensure the application is user-friendly, with a clean and intuitive interface that makes it easy for users to add and manage tasks.
Responsiveness: Ensure the application is responsive, working well on different devices and screen sizes.
Accessibility: Ensure the application is accessible, following web accessibility guidelines to make it usable by users with disabilities.
Testing: Thoroughly test the application to ensure it works as expected, with no bugs or errors

HTML Structure:

The HTML structure is well-organized and follows a logical hierarchy. The main elements are:

header: Contains the application title and navigation menu.
main: Contains the task section, form to add new tasks, and the to-do list.
section.task-section: Displays the task cards.
div.task-cards: Contains the individual task cards.
div.task-card: Represents a single task card with title, description, and "Done" button.
form#todo-form: Allows users to add new tasks.
ul#todo-list: Displays the to-do list.
CSS (style.css):

The CSS file is provided and contains styles for the HTML structure. The styles focus on making the application visually appealing and user-friendly. The main styles include:

Adding margin and padding to the task-section element.
Styling the task-cards element with a flexbox layout to display the task cards in a grid.
Styling the task-card elements with a background color, padding, margin, border, and box shadow.
Styling the task-btn elements with a background color, text color, padding, border radius, and cursor pointer.
JavaScript (index.js):

The JavaScript file is not provided, but it is assumed to contain the logic for the application. The script should:

Add event listeners to the "Done" buttons to mark tasks as completed.
Add event listeners to the "Add Task" button to add new tasks to the to-do list.
Update the to-do list dynamically when new tasks are added or tasks are marked as completed.
Functionality:

The application should have the following functionality:

Display a list of tasks in a card-based format.
Allow users to add new tasks using the form.
Mark tasks as completed when the "Done" button is clicked.
Update the to-do list dynamically when new tasks are added or tasks are marked as completed.

Conclusion:

The project has a solid foundation with a well-structured HTML file and a CSS file that adds styles to the application. However, the JavaScript file is missing, which is crucial for the application's functionality. With the addition of the JavaScript file, the application can be completed and provide a user-friendly to-do list experience.
